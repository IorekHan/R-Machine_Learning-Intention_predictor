The dataset that is used in the current project comes from Sakar et al.(2019), in which the authors designed a system that could predict online shoppers purchasing intention and page abandonment. Online shoppers purchasing intention was cast as a binary classification problem, such that viewers would either made the final purchase or not. The dataset consists of 12330 sessions, of which record a session that a viewer visited items of the websites. Each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. The dataset is highly imbalanced for 84.5%(10422) of the viewers did not make the final purchase.
